# Privacy Policy

Kaiteki is a free and open-source client for social-networking sites (SNS). By
default it does not share any personal information and acts solely as a client
to said SNS sites.

## Legalese

### Data stored

The following data will be stored locally on the device:

- User identity (Username, service domain and type, etc.)
- Tokens (includes tokens for 3rd-party services accessed by the user)

### Data deletion

To request your data transmitted to services to be deleted, contact your service
administrator. Kaiteki does not administrate the services accessible within.

### Error reports

Kaiteki is capable of generating a URL that leads to GitHub with prefilled
information about the error to create an issue ticket.

The form can contain the following data:

- Error type and message
- Stack trace
- Data received (may contain personal information)
- App version
- Operating system type and version

The creation of a ticket requires a GitHub account. The user has the ability to
delete their issue ticket on GitHub at will.

### Feedback

Users are capable of sending feedback to the developers of Kaiteki. In the
process of this, the same data as of an error report is collected, including the
data the user is willing to enter, such as the message body and the optional
email address.

The feedback cannot be requested to be deleted and will be manually deleted off
the receiving server.
